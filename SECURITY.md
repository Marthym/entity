# Security Policy

Security is a top priority for our open-source project. We are committed to ensuring the protection of user data, 
privacy, and the integrity of the source code. This security policy outlines our practices and procedures 
for maintaining a secure development environment.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We encourage all users, developers, and security researchers to report any vulnerabilities or security issues they 
discover. You can do so by following these steps:

1. Send an email to our security team at [contact-bw AT ght1pc9kc DOT fr]() with complete details of the vulnerability.
2. Wait for a confirmation of receipt from us. We will keep you informed of the progress of resolving the vulnerability.
3. We will promptly address the vulnerability and take necessary steps to fix it. We will work with you to responsibly resolve the issue.

## Security Updates

We are committed to providing timely security updates for our open-source software. Users are encouraged to keep their 
installations up to date by installing these updates as soon as they are available.

## Accountability Policy

Our development team takes responsibility for addressing reported vulnerabilities in a reasonable timeframe. However, 
we cannot guarantee specific timelines for resolution as it depends on the complexity of the vulnerability and available resources. We are committed to transparently collaborating with security researchers and users to responsibly resolve issues.

## Contact

If you have questions, concerns, or wish to report a vulnerability, please contact us at
